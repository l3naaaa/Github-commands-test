Useful commands

code <filename> - Will open vscode editor with the filename give (a new file will be opened if file doesn’t exist - NOTE YOU NEED TO SAVE the file otherwise it won’t have the contents)


mv <source> < destination >
cp <source> <destination>

Both of the above “/“ after name means the directory contents!! NOT the directory itself 


touch <filename> will just create a blank file with NOTHING inside it.


mkdir <directory name> (will create the directory where ever you are)
mkdir -p <directory/directory/directory> will create ALL the directory underneath each other (I will explain this later)
